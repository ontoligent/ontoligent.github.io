title: "Humanities Data Science Collaboratory"
editor: visual
---

We are founded on the premise that DS needs the Humanities and the Humanities needs DS.

-   DS give the Humanities expertise in processing and modeling data.

-   The Humanities give DS critical skills and design expertise.

The humanities are rooted in history.

-   The data of the Humanities are primary sources, "the records left by man".

-   Language is the medium through which history is transmitted and understood.

-   The output of the Humanities is narrative.

We seek to sponsor projects, collaborations, and colloquia Current projects and collaborations include:

-   The Multepal Project.

-   The DH Certificate.

-   Gaming Lab with IHGC.
